0. What if the planets were the room of my house?
1. I love looking at the stars. The amazing solar system has 8 planets. Planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune each unique and different in their own way.
2. Mercury is the closest to the sun and would be my kitchen. Mercury is the red planet. It is so hot I could cook anything 
3. Venus is so bright that I would use it for my study room. Venus is windy and rotates in reverse and has the most volcanoes of any planet. 
4. If I needed to shower Earth with its rivers would be my bathroom. 71% of the earth is water.Earth is also Venus’s sister planet.
5. Mars is the fourth planet and would be my living room. The red planet would be an attractive and cool place to bring your guests. 
6. Jupiter the fifth planet has 63 known satellites and is the largest planet. Jupiter would be my master bedroom.
7. Saturn is the sixth planet and has the most beautiful rings. It’s also the second largest.Saturn with its rings would be my playroom. 
8. Uranus the seventh planet with its moons and rocks would be my ? 
9. Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and my backyard. I would look into the galaxy in the evenings and enjoy my view.
